## Try Keras Datasets

We'll be adding new datasets from time to time. This readme is here to ensure you know exactly where you can download them.

As you probably know, datasets can be large (100MB +) so storing all datasets on GitHub isn't always practical. Come back to this README for any updates. Naturally, if you download a dataset locally you may have to re-upload to use on Colab or another cloud-based jupyter notebook.
